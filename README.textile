h2. Introduction

_classes_for_types_ is a plugin for Ruby on Rails.

In short. Take the following ERB code:

<pre>  <%= f.text_field :title %></pre>

*Without classes_for_types*, it renders as:

<pre>  <input id="thing_title" name="thing[title]" size="30" type="text" /></pre>

*With classes_for_types* though, it produces the following output:

<pre>  <input class="text" id="thing_title" name="thing[title]" size="30" type="text" /></pre>


h2. A bit more of detail

This plugin simply adds a class name to tags that include a _type_ attribute. The new class name is equal to the type. This is useful for styling forms, as some popular browsers do not have a CSS engine that supports attribute selectors.

Please note that this behaviour is not restricted to form-related elements. Any HTML element rendered using Rails's _tag()_ helper will be affected. (This includes any standard Rails's helper that renders any tags whatsoever).
